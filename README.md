# Survival_Prediction_On_Titanic_Dataset

1.) This work is a part of a class assignment where I performed the logistic regression on Titanic dataset to predict survival utilizing Bayesian Statistical modelling techniques. 

2.) R statistical software has been used to do analysis. Coding is done using R markdown and LaTeX to generate reports in PDF as wells HTML.

3.) ggplot was extensively used to visualize the data and generate plots like histogram, density plots, bar graphs and boxplots.

4.) FInally, Logistic regression has been performed to predict the chance of survival based on sex(Male or Female) for three different categories of tickets (1st, 2nd and 3rd class).
